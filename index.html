        It is the first half of a well known stoic quote, which comes from Jerzy
        Gregorek. Tim Ferriss also used it as a reference point in his
        <strong>TED talk.</strong> In the talk, Tim explains the rationale to
        his fear setting process, and how it draws on Stoic
        <em>philosophy.</em> Tim uses the quote to support the use of his fear
        <u>setting process.</u>

        Jerzy framed the quote to explain his journey from alcoholism to Olympic
        weight-lifting glory. It is some turnaround. Of course, the quote has
        everything and nothing to do with alcohol and the Olympics. It has a
        much deeper meaning than that. It reaches across the life weâ€™re all
        trying to live and it can help us as it helped Jerzy and Tim.
